# Day 1

Spinning Tori around text.

# Original

You can see the original post [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CjTOmJurhRg/).
The original has 3 tori represented as isosurfaces, basically meta-tori.
There is also text in the center of the original, which iterates between, "A", "B", "C", "1", "2", and "3".
The original is also scaled to give it a pixelated effect, and reduces the color space to a lower number of colors. Which gives it a retro look.

# Interpretation

My interpretation is also 3 tori, but they aren't isosurfaces.
The colors on my interpretation are softer, and in a full color space.
The text and pixelation is the same as the original though.
